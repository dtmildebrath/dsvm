# dsvm
A mixed-integer programming based tool for computing (linear) separating hyperplanes.
The code uses the [Gurobi solver](https://www.gurobi.com/) (free license for academics) 
to compute a minimum-classification error, maximum-margin (in that order) separating 
hyperplane for binary classification data. It also optionally performs a sensitivity analysis,
by computing the minimum and maximum values of the (normalized) separating hyperplane coefficients
for each feature among the set of all minimum-error separating hyperplanes.

Because the code relies on mixed-integer programming, it is typically only suitable for small
datasets.

One useful application is to verify whether a given dataset is or is not linearly separable, via
the `minimum_error` function.
